<strong>[Idea]:</strong> I was debating if we need a services landing page and was thinking we could maybe group our services content in 3 sections: websites, ecommerce and SP and office 365. 
This is a general landing page for our website offerings. We can provide general info about our solutions and then link off to sub pages for craft, wordpress etc

<h3>Exceptional UX is not a nice-to-have</h3>
<p>We beleive in effective and clean designs. When it comes to the web, UX design is analogous to customer service. When it comes to business websites, your user's are your customers. If design is providing frustration or confusion, it is akin to providing bad customer service. A clean and organized digital expereince establishes a sense of trust, professionalism and will prevent your brand from being overlooked.</p>
<br>
<h3>The right tool for the job</h3>
<p>One size doesnt fit all. Many development agencies pigeonhole customer's project needs into their preffered tech-stack. Before writing a single line of code, we take into consideration budget, schedule, requirements, project goals and customersâ€™ level of technical profiency before deciding a CMS or technical approach.</p>
