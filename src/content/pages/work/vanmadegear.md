In 2021, Vanmade Gear was seeking help re-branding and re-launching their existing eCommerce site that was built on wooCommerce. Tway was brought in to replace an under-performing development team, and to bring to life the new brand vision on the Shopify platform.

The objective was to scale an already successful business through driving sales, increasing taffic and growing brand awareness.

Vanmade gear is a company that specialises in premium window shades for RV vans targetting vanlifers, digital nomads and retirees.
