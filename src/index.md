  text: <h3>Exceptional UX is not a nice-to-have</h3>

    <p>We beleive in effective and clean designs. When it comes to the web, UX design is analogous to customer service. When it comes to business websites, your user's are your customers. If design is providing frustration or confusion, it is akin to providing bad customer service. A clean and organized digital expereince establishes a sense of trust, professionalism and will prevent your brand from being overlooked.</p>

    <h3>The right tool for the job</h3>

    <p>One size doesnt fit all. Many development agencies pigeonhole customer's project needs into their preffered tech-stack. Before writing a single line of code, we take into consideration budget, schedule, requirements, project goals and customersâ€™ level of technical profiency before deciding a CMS or technical approach.</p>

    <h3>Pride in performance</h3>

    <p>Our web solutions are optimized to provide excellent speed. For our devs, peformance is an obsession. We know the cost of a slow website. Today's user's are unapollegtically impatient and will not wait for a slow page load. A slow site will cost your business.</p>

    <h3>Optimized for Google, SEO/SEA and Accessibility</h3>

    <p>What good is a website that is hard to find? All of our websites are optimized to receive a perfect techincal SEO and accessibility score from Google.</p>
