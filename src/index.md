    titleSummary: 'A Front-end Developer building lightning-fast, user-friendly websites.'
    summary: >-
      <p>I am front-end developer with a background in enterprise IT consulting.
      My passion for web development stems from the creative challenges it
      presents, and I find great fulfillment in solving complex problems through
      coding. After a near decade working in the corporate world, I made the
      decision to relocate to Chiang Mai, Thailand, where I now work as a
      freelancer. I specialize in helping small and medium-sized businesses
      build and maintain their online presence, leveraging my expertise in
      platforms such as Shopify, WordPress, and Craft CMS.</p>

      <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy going on off-road adventures on my
      motorcycle in northern Thailand. I find the physical challenge of
      navigating new trails to be a great balance to the mental demands of web
      development. I also have an interest in trying new dishes and exploring
      different flavors during my travels.</p>
